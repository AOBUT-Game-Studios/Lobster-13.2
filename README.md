# Lobster-13.2
Lobster 13.2 is a game that asks a simple question, what would be it be like if your rival was a lobster that is 13.2 times stronger in every conceivable way than an average lobster? To answer this question, uh... we uhh.. honestly I'm not too sure. This project is going to be a set of prototype games all themed around lobsters, the idea is for the game to be a testing/practice ground for game concepts for me and my friends. Even if I don't know you, if you happen to come across this project and find some inspiration from the game, feel free to contribute your own lobster games to the project. Just shoot a push request and I'll look over the addition, even if isn't anything special, I'd love to include it in the final cut if I can. The project will be coded in the godot game engine, because we are based.

## How to contribute
In the Scenes folder, create a new folder named accordingly to the addition you'd like to make to the game. For example If I were to make an rpg section, I would create a new folder called RPG and then keep all the scenes and scripts needed for the rpg in that folder. Do it this way to avoid merge conflicts, and keep maintain project structure. If you want to edit a pre existing project started by someone else, just keep in mind that I'll have to merge the new changes, likely with the permission of whoever originally started that folder. You can include a README file if you'd like to document anything you make, it would definetely be helpful, as well as maintain credit where it's due.

While I could make this project span several branches for efficientcy, I kinda prefer the idea of just keeping everything contained together in the same github, because idk, I'm dumb and lazy, things may change in the future.
