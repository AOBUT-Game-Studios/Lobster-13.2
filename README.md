# Lobster-13.2
Lobster 13.2 is a game that asks a simple question, what would be it be like if your rival was a lobster that is 13.2 times stronger in every conceivable way than an average lobster? To answer this question, uh... we uhh.. honestly I'm not too sure. This project is going to be a set of prototype games all themed around lobsters, the idea is for the game to be a testing/practice ground for game concepts for me and my friends. Even if I don't know you, if you happen to come across this project and find some inspiration from the game, feel free to contribute your own lobster games to the project. Just shoot a push request and I'll look over the addition, even if isn't anything special, I'd love to include it in the final cut if I can. The project will be coded in the godot game engine, because we are based.
